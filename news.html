        <h2>Inspired by Oysters?</h2><br>
        <p>We’ve always been fascinated by how humans discover so many technological advancements from nature. I
            stumbled across a video of oysters filtering water – in just 5 hours, a couple of oysters turn a completely
            filthy tank into something clean! In fact, they can filter up to 50 gal/water a day. We had a discussion
            over lunch about if they could alter fresh water mussels to filter out bacteria, we could just ship them to
            poor countries and have a living filtration system.
        </p> <br>
        <p>While fleshing out details for Atrio – we knew we wanted an assembly line, but we thought, “what if instead
            of building everything out of metal, we incorporated living things?” You could capture living creatures, and
            have them do tasks machines can’t do - Digest and produce other compounds the same way we can’t print
            spider-silk.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And after 5 years, you can do just that. Come join us on this mysterious, hilarious, and spooky adventure,
            and good luck out in the dark.</p>
